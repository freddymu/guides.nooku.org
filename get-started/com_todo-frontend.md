# Todo Component Frontend

Most components built for Joomla! have both a Frontend application, the site and a Backend application, the administrator.
In this section of the tutorial we'll focus on getting off the ground by showing you
how to:
* Create a Component Entry Point
* Register your Component with Joomla!
* Get your first views to work with almost NO CODE
* Build a database table for your Todos, which in turn, builds your model automatically, with NO CODE
