# RESTful JSON API

If you build a view in a Nooku powered component it will have a [JSON API]((http://jsonapi.org) version almost automatically.

JSON API is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, and discoverability.

As the specification matures we'll make more changes to achieve 100% compatibility.
