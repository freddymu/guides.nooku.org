# Todo Component Backend

Now we're going to create the back-end for our component, com_todo.
In other words we will create the environment for an administrator to manage all the Todo Items in the system: create/modify/delete Items.

Here are some of the things you'll learn:

* Change the Default View or Your Component
* Create a Backend List View
* Create a Form to Edit Your Todos
* Add an Actionbar to Your Views
* Add a Menubar to Your List View
