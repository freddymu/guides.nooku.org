# Contribute to the Guides

We encourage our community to contribute to the Guides (in fact we encourage you to contribute to the Framework as well).

_Maybe you've figured out something that you would like to share?_ ... [Write a Tutorial](contribute/write-a-tutorial.md)!

_See something that's not quite complete or even in the sections of the Guides?_...Feel free to write or rewrite it for the rest of the community.

Simply fork this Nooku Guides repository, and when you are done with your (carefully reviewed) edits make a Pull Request so we can review.

## Gitbook

We use [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook#how-to-use-it) to produce the guides, and suggest you get it as well.
A good way to work is to use:
```shell
  $  cd /Your/Book/Path
  $  gitbook serve
```
And look at your work at http://localhost:4000 . As you edit and save your pages, your book will refresh in a moment as Gitbook
detects a file change.
